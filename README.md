# pidgin-to-adium-emote-pack-converter
Converts Pidgin emote pack "theme" files to adium "Emoticons.plist" equivalents.
Please test this on various Pidgin emote packs and report any errors to
trevelyaninc@gmail.com.  
  
To load your emote pack into Adium, add .AdiumEmoticonSet to the end of the Pidgin folder name after creating the Emoticons.plist set, then put the file into the /Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Emoticons/ folder. Restart Adium and if it is done correctly Adium will add the emoticon pack to the list.
